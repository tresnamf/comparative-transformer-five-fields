29068076,Emg-Based Estimation Of Limb Movement Using Deep Learning With Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks,"A novel model based on deep learning is proposed to estimate kinematic information for myoelectric control from multi-channel electromyogram (EMG) signals. The neural information of limb movement is embedded in EMG signals that are influenced by all kinds of factors. In order to overcome the negative effects of variability in signals, the proposed model employs the deep architecture combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The EMG signals are transformed to time-frequency frames as the input to the model. The limb movement is estimated by the model that is trained with the gradient descent and backpropagation procedure. We tested the model for simultaneous and proportional estimation of limb movement in eight healthy subjects and compared it with support vector regression (SVR) and CNNs on the same data set. The experimental studies show that the proposed model has higher estimation accuracy and better robustness with respect to time. The combination of CNNs and RNNs can improve the model performance compared with using CNNs alone. The model of deep architecture is promising in EMG decoding and optimization of network structures can increase the accuracy and robustness.",2018,"Xia P, Hu J, Peng Y",38,"Adult, Biomechanical Phenomena, Computer Simulation, Electromyography, Female, Hand, Humans, Machine Learning, Male, Models, Biological, Movement, Neural Networks, Computer, Young Adult",Journal Article,Artificial organs,42,E67-E77,-,Journal Article,-,5/1/2018,No,FALSE,No,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29068076,10.1111/aor.13004,PubMed,N/A,0.604954319,Moderately relevant,Moderately relevant,2,TRUE,2,2,1.892789261,1.892789261,,,

To address this issue, wearable exoskeletons have emerged as promising solutions. Effective human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for seamlessly integrating these technologies into rehabilitation and assistive care settings. Electromyography (EMG) signals offer valuable insights into human muscular control and have been utilized to control robotic systems, enhancing user acceptance and interaction. This paper proposes a novel technique for continuously predicting joint movements from raw single-channel EMG signals using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture. First, single-channel EMG signals from the biceps are acquired simultaneously with the elbow angular position, and the acquired data are then converted into a dataset for supervised learning. Second, a neural architecture based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) is proposed and implemented for the training phase. Finally, the proposed model is tested on real data, and the results are thoroughly evaluated using three evaluation metrics. We achieved RMSE=3.84~12.72ﾂｰ, MAE=2.92~10.24ﾂｰ, and R-squared=0.96~0.99.

To study the neural control of movement, it is often necessary to estimate how muscles are activated across a variety of behavioral conditions. One approach is to try extracting the underlying neural command signal to muscles by applying latent variable modeling methods to electromyographic (EMG) recordings.

Classifiers are trained for the rehabilitative system to comprehend the desires of the patient whose upper limbs do not function properly. Electromyography (EMG) signals and Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are used widely for upper limb movement classification. By analysing the classification results of the real-time EEG and EMG signals, the system can understand the intention of the user and predict the events that one would like to carry out. Accordingly, it will provide external help to the user. However, the noise in the real-time EEG and EMG data collection process contaminates the effectiveness of the data, which undermines classification performance. Moreover, not all patients process strong EMG signals due to muscle damage and neuromuscular disorder. To address these issues, this paper explores different feature extraction techniques and machine learning and deep learning models for EEG and EMG signals classification and proposes a novel decision-level multisensor fusion technique to integrate EEG signals with EMG signals. This system retrieves effective information from both sources to understand and predict the desire of the user, and thus aid.

39361489,Simultaneous Estimation Of Digit Tip Forces And Hand Postures In A Simulated Real-Life Condition With High-Density Electromyography And Deep Learning,"In myoelectric control, continuous estimation of multiple degrees of freedom has an important role. Most studies have focused on estimating discrete postures or forces of the human hand but for a practical prosthetic system, both should be considered. In daily life activities, hand postures vary for grasping different objects and the amount of force exerted on each fingertip depends on the shape and weight of the object. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of continuous estimation of multiple degrees of freedom. We proposed a reach and grasp framework to study both absolute fingertip forces and hand movement types using deep learning techniques applied to high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG). Four daily life grasp types were examined and absolute fingertip forces were simultaneously estimated while grasping various objects, along with the grasp types. We showed that combining a 3-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN) with a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) can reliably and continuously estimate the digit tip forces and classify different hand postures in human individuals. The mean absolute error (MAE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) results of the force estimation problem across all fingers and subjects were 0.46 ﾂｱ 0.23 and 0.90 ﾂｱ 0.03% respectively and for the classification problem, they were 0.04 ﾂｱ 0.01 and 0.97 ﾂｱ 0.02%.

38442056,Graph-Driven Simultaneous And Proportional Estimation Of Wrist Angle And Grasp Force Via High-Density Emg,"Myoelectric prostheses are generally unable to accurately control the position and force simultaneously, prohibiting natural and intuitive human-machine interaction. This issue is attributed to the limitations of myoelectric interfaces in effectively decoding multi-degree-of-freedom (multi-DoF) kinematic and kinetic information. We thus propose a novel multi-task, spatial-temporal model driven by graphical high-density electromyography (HD-EMG) for simultaneous and proportional control of wrist angle and grasp force. Twelve subjects were recruited to perform three multi-DoF movements, including wrist pronation/supination, wrist flexion/extension, and wrist abduction/adduction while varying grasp force. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model outperformed five baseline models, with the normalized root mean square error of 13.2% and 9.7% and the correlation coefficient of 89.6% and 91.9% for wrist angle and grasp force estimation, respectively. In addition, the proposed model still maintained comparable accuracy even with a significant reduction in the number of HD-EMG electrodes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to achieve simultaneous and proportional wrist angle and grasp force control via HD-EMG and has the potential to empower prostheses users to perform a broader range of tasks with greater precision and control, ultimately enhancing their independence and quality of life.",2024,"Li D, Kang P, Yu Y, Shull PB",N/A,"Adult, Humans, Young Adult, Biomechanical Phenomena, Computer Graphics, Correlation of Data, Data Visualization, Electrodes, Electromyography, Hand Strength, Man-Machine Systems, Neural Networks, Computer, Prostheses and Implants, Wrist, Deep Learning, Data Analysis, Movement",Journal Article,IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,28,2723-2732,-,Journal Article,-,5/1/2024,No,FALSE,No,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38442056,10.1109/JBHI.2024.3373432,PubMed,N/A,0.456632313,Somewhat relevant,Moderately relevant,8,FALSE,1,2,0.315464877,0.94639463,,,

Two key constraints have been the limited range of movements and the lack of simultaneous control capabilities. This study aims to address these issues by introducing an LSTM-based approach for the continuous control of critical parameters in prosthetic limbs.

Recent research has suggested the use of multimodal inputs (sEMG signals and inertial measurements) to improve estimation performance. This work focused on assessing the use of angular velocity in combination with myoelectric signals to simultaneously and continuously predict 12 joint angles in the hand. Estimation performance was evaluated for five functional and grasping movements in 20 subjects. The proposed method is based on convolutional and recurrent neural networks using transfer learning (TL). A novel aspect was the use of a pretrained deep network model from basic joint hand movements to learn new patterns present in functional motions.

In spite of its complex design, the user efforts to perform various actions are quite minimal. Robotic hands are a mere counterpart of the natural hand, with similar flexion and extension capabilities. Over the past decades, the robotic arms play a significant role in certain applications like aiding the patients and doctors. Surface EMG signals can be retrieved in a non-invasive manner for predicting the movements of the person for the simultaneous control of the robotic arm. With Deep Learning presently in the field of Artificial Intelligence, it has paved the way for a robust and accurate system. In this paper, a Deep learning based classification technique is adopted for the classification of EMG signals collected using Myo band for the flexion of various fingers at resting position. A Convolutional Neural Network based model is presented in the paper to classify 5 different actions such as thumb flexion, index flexion, ring flexion, little flexion and rest position from the data collected from 10 subjects. An accuracy of 72.5% is observed over the custom dataset after filtering out the raw data using signal processing techniques.

It has been widely used in the field of prosthetics and other assistive systems because of the physiological connection between muscle electrical activity and movement dynamics. However, most existing sEMG-based decoding algorithms show a limited number of detectable degrees of freedom that can be proportionally and simultaneously controlled in real-time, which limits the use of EMG in a wide range of applications, including prosthetics and other consumer-level applications (e.g., human/machine interfacing). In this work, we propose a new deep learning method that can decode and map the electrophysiological activity of the forearm muscles into proportional and simultaneous control of > 20 degrees of freedom of the human hand with real-time resolution and with latency within the neuromuscular delays (< 50 ms). We recorded the kinematics of the human hand during grasping, pinching, individual digit movements and three gestures at slow (0.5 Hz) and fast (0.75 Hz) movement speeds in healthy participants. We demonstrate that our neural network can predict the kinematics of the hand in real-time at a constant 32 predictions per second. To achieve this, we employed transfer learning and created a prediction smoothing algorithm for the output of the neural network that reconstructed the full geometry of the hand in three-dimensional Cartesian space in real-time. Our results demonstrate that high-density EMG signals from the forearm muscles contain almost all the information that is needed to predict the kinematics of the human hand.

c048ab2ec64b3cd1a55d08c8156f4863e8faff0d,Physics-Informed Deep Learning For Musculoskeletal Modeling: Predicting Muscle Forces And Joint Kinematics From Surface Emg,"Musculoskeletal models have been widely used for detailed biomechanical analysis to characterise various functional impairments given their ability to estimate movement variables (i.e., muscle forces and joint moments) which cannot be readily measured in vivo. Physics-based computational neuromusculoskeletal models can interpret the dynamic interaction between neural drive to muscles, muscle dynamics, body and joint kinematics and kinetics. Still, such set of solutions suffers from slowness, especially for the complex models, hindering the utility in real-time applications. In recent years, data-driven methods have emerged as a promising alternative due to the benefits in speedy and simple implementation, but they cannot reflect the underlying neuromechanical processes. This paper proposes a physics-informed deep learning framework for musculoskeletal modelling, where physics-based domain knowledge is brought into the data-driven model as soft constraints to penalise/regularise the data-driven model. We use the synchronous muscle forces and joint kinematics prediction from surface electromyogram (sEMG) as the exemplar to illustrate the proposed framework. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is employed as the deep neural network to implement the proposed framework. Simultaneously, the physics law between muscle forces and joint kinematics is used the soft constraint.

Many studies in the literature show that applying robotic gait rehabilitation to patients with neurological disorders such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Stroke and Spinal Cord Injection (SCI) effectively restores gait ability. In contrast to the studies in the literature that included only healthy individuals, both the control and patient groups were formed and detailed analyses were carried out for both groups. In this study, EMG signals in GMA, GME, ILP, BF, VM, MG, TA muscles were recorded simultaneously with a different electrode placement during robotic gait for the first time in literature and then a location that prevents a phase shift was presented. The classification performance has also been increased by removing 26 different attribute parameters like time, frequency and statistics from the signals instead of gait studies with a maximum of 12-16 traits extraction.

40644172,"Simultaneous Recognition Of Locomotion Mode, Phase, And Phase Progression Using Deep Learning Models","Despite advances in gait-assist wearable robots, application in real-world scenarios remains limited, largely due to challenges in developing an effective user intention recognition algorithm. These algorithms are crucial as they enable the robot to move harmoniously with the user by predicting their intent during various locomotion activities such as level walking, stair ascent, stair descent, and sit-to-stand. It is essential to not only identify these locomotion modes but also their phases and progression for real-time assistance. Traditional classification methods often require extensive manual feature extraction from signals like those from inertial measurement units (IMU), electromyography, and plantar force sensors. Recent machine learning, particularly deep learning approaches, have simplified this process through automatic feature extraction. However, no existing method simultaneously predicts locomotion modes, phases, and phase progression, which is significant for personalized assistance. This study introduces a deep learning framework that classifies locomotion modes and phases and estimates the phase progressions using IMU data from sensors placed on the sternum and limbs. Results from five participants show that our model effectively classifies the locomotion phase and well estimates the phase progression percentage.

37980798,Contranet: A Hybrid Network For Improving The Classification Of Eeg And Emg Signals With Limited Training Data,"Bio-Signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) are widely used for the rehabilitation of physically disabled people and for the characterization of cognitive impairments. Successful decoding of these bio-signals is however non-trivial because of the time-varying and non-stationary characteristics. Furthermore, existence of short- and long-range dependencies in these time-series signal makes the decoding even more challenging. State-of-the-art studies proposed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based architectures for the classification of these bio-signals, which are proven useful to learn spatial representations. However, CNNs because of the fixed size convolutional kernels and shared weights pay only uniform attention and are also suboptimal in learning short-long term dependencies, simultaneously, which could be pivotal in decoding EEG and EMG signals. Therefore, it is important to address these limitations of CNNs. To learn short- and long-range dependencies simultaneously and to pay more attention to more relevant part of the input signal, Transformer neural network-based architectures can play a significant role. Nonetheless, it requires a large corpus of training data. However, EEG and EMG decoding studies produce limited amount of the data. Therefore, using standalone transformers neural networks produce ordinary results. In this study, we ask a question whether we can fix the limitations of CNN and transformer neural networks and provide a robust and generalized model that can simultaneously learn spatial patterns, long-short term dependencies, pay variable amount of attention to time-varying non-stationary input signal with limited training data.",2024,"Ali O, Saif-Ur-Rehman M, Glasmachers T, Iossifidis I, Klaes C",N/A,"Humans, Machine Learning, Brain-Computer Interfaces, Movement, Neural Networks, Computer, Algorithms, Electroencephalography, Imagination",Journal Article,Computers in biology and medicine,168,107649,-,Journal Article,-,1/1/2024,No,FALSE,No,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37980798,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107649,PubMed,N/A,0.373982586,Low relevance,,,,,,,,,,

30212573,"Real-Time, Simultaneous Myoelectric Control Using A Convolutional Neural Network","The evolution of deep learning techniques has been transformative as they have allowed complex mappings to be trained between control inputs and outputs without the need for feature engineering. In this work, a myoelectric control system based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed as a possible alternative to traditional approaches that rely on specifically designed features. This CNN-based system is validated using a real-time Fitts' law style target acquisition test requiring single and combined wrist motions. The performance of the proposed system is then compared to that of a standard support vector machine (SVM) based myoelectric system using a set of time-domain features. Despite the prevalence and demonstrated performance of these well-known features, no significant difference (p>0.05) was found between the two methods for any of the computed control metrics. This demonstrates the potential for automated learning approaches to extract complex and rich information from stochastic biological signals. This first evaluation of the usability of a CNN in a real-time myoelectric control environment provides a basis for further exploration.",2018,"Ameri A, Akhaee MA, Scheme E, Englehart K",30,"Adult, Electromyography, Humans, Movement, Muscle, Skeletal, Neural Networks, Computer, Pattern Recognition, Automated, Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted, Stochastic Processes, Support Vector Machine, Wrist",Comparative Study,PloS one,13,e0203835,N/A,Other Type,N/A,1/1/2018,Yes,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6136764/pdf,Yes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30212573,10.1371/journal.pone.0203835,PubMed,-,0.3581579,Low relevance,,,,,,,,,,
38276352,Ensemble Learning Method For The Continuous Decoding Of Hand Joint Angles,"Human-machine interface technology is fundamentally constrained by the dexterity of motion decoding. Simultaneous and proportional control can greatly improve the flexibility and dexterity of smart prostheses. In this research, a new model using ensemble learning to solve the angle decoding problem is proposed. Ultimately, seven models for angle decoding from surface electromyography (sEMG) signals are designed. The kinematics of five angles of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints are estimated using the sEMG recorded during functional tasks. The estimation performance was evaluated through the Pearson correlation coefficient (CC). In this research, the comprehensive model, which combines CatBoost and LightGBM, is the best model for this task, whose average CC value and RMSE are 0.897 and 7.09. The mean of the CC and the mean of the RMSE for all the test scenarios of the subjects' dataset outperform the results of the Gaussian process model, with significant differences. Moreover, the research proposed a whole pipeline that uses ensemble learning to build a high-performance angle decoding system for the hand motion recognition task. Researchers or engineers in this field can quickly find the most suitable ensemble learning model for angle decoding through this process, with fewer parameters and fewer training data requirements than traditional deep learning models. In conclusion, the proposed ensemble learning approach has the potential for simultaneous and proportional control (SPC) of future hand prostheses.",2024,"Wang H, Tao Q, Zhang X",3,"Humans, Movement, Hand, Electromyography, Artificial Limbs, Hand Joints, Machine Learning",Journal Article,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",24,N/A,-,Journal Article,-,1/20/2024,Yes,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11154387/pdf,Yes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38276352,10.3390/s24020660,PubMed,"sEMG, hand joint angle, ensemble learning, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, stacking",0.355869415,Low relevance,,,,,,,,,,

Compared to the current standard surface electromyography (EMG), in magnetomyography (MMG), OPM sensors offer the advantage of contactless measurements of muscle activity. However, little is known about the relative performance of OPM-MMG and EMG, e.g. in their ability to detect and classify finger movements. To address this in a proof-of-principle study, we recorded simultaneous OPM-MMG and EMG of finger flexor muscles for the discrimination of individual finger movements on a single human participant. Using a deep learning model for movement classification, we found that both sensor modalities were able to discriminate finger movements with above 89% accuracy. Furthermore, model predictions for the two sensor modalities showed high agreement in movement detection (85% agreement; Cohen・EEEE・EEEEs kappa: 0.45). Our findings show that OPM sensors can be employed for c",2023,"Antonino Greco, Sangyeob Baek, T. Middelmann, C. Mehring, C. Braun, J. Marquetand, M.

40511365,Simultaneous Estimation Of Hand Configurations And Finger Joint Angles Using Forearm Ultrasound,"With the advancement in computing and robotics, it is necessary to develop fluent and intuitive methods for interacting with digital systems, augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) interfaces, and physical robotic systems. Hand motion recognition is widely used to enable these interactions. Hand configuration classification and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint angle detection is important for a comprehensive reconstruction of hand motion. Surface electromyography (sEMG) and other technologies have been used for the detection of hand motions. Forearm ultrasound images provide a musculoskeletal visualization that can be used to understand hand motion. Recent work has shown that these ultrasound images can be classified using machine learning to estimate discrete hand configurations. Estimating both hand configuration and MCP joint angles based on forearm ultrasound has not been addressed in the literature. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning pipeline for predicting the MCP joint angles. The results for the hand configuration classification were compared by using different machine learning algorithms. Support vector classifier with different kernels, multi-layer perceptron, and the proposed CNN have been used to classify the ultrasound images into 11 hand configurations based on activities of daily living. Forearm ultrasound images were acquired from 6 subjects instructed to move their hands according to predefined hand configurations. Motion capture data was acquired to get the finger angles corresponding to the hand movements at different speeds (0.5 Hz, 1 Hz, & 2 Hz) for the index, middle, ring, and pinky fingers. Average classification accuracy of 82.7 ﾂｱ 9.7% for the proposed CNN and over 80% for SVC for different kernels was observed on a subset of the dataset. An average RMSE of 7.35ﾂｰﾂｱ1.3ﾂｰ was obtained between the predicted and the true MCP joint angles. A low latency (6.25 - 9.1 Hz) pipeline has been proposed for estimating both MCP joint angles and hand configuration aimed at real-time control of human-machine interfaces.",2023,"Bimbraw K, Nycz CJ, Schueler M, Zhang Z, Zhang HK",N/A,N/A,Journal Article,IEEE transactions on medical robotics and bionics,5,120-132,-,Journal Article,-,2/1/2023,Yes,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12162105/pdf,Yes,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40511365,10.1109/tmrb.2023.3237774,PubMed,"AI-enabled robotics, gesture, posture, and facial expressions, wearable robotics, design and development of robots for human-robot interaction, human-machine interfaces and robotics applications, new technologies and methodologies in medical robotics, wearable sensor systems, user-centered design and applications",0.328737764,Low relevance,,,,,,,,,,

40190045,Hybrid Electromagnetic-Triboelectric Hip Energy Harvester For Wearables And Ai-Assisted Motion Monitoring,"Reliable human motion monitoring is crucial across various fields such as sports, healthcare, and metaverse. This study introduces an AI-assisted wearable hip joint energy harvester (HJEH) designed to convert mechanical energy from hip joint movements into electric power for wearable devices while simultaneously monitoring human motion. The HJEH utilizes an electromagnetic generator (EMG) in conjunction with a freestanding triboelectric nanogenerator (FS-TENG) to achieve energy harvesting and motion sensing. The EMG specifically recovers the negative energy from hip joint motion to generate electricity, with a flywheel and acceleration gears employ to enhance output power. Concurrently, the FS-TENG generates triboelectric signals driven by hip joint motions, which are processed using deep learning algorithms for accurate motion detection. The performance of the HJEH is thoroughly evaluated through bench tests, treadmill tests, and outdoor experiments.
